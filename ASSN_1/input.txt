Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity. He was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the German Empire. 
Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, where he renounced his German citizenship and remained stateless until becoming a Swiss citizen in 1901. 
He later obtained his doctorate in 1905 and published four groundbreaking papers, including the famous E=mc^2 equation.
In 1915, Einstein completed the general theory of relativity, which became a major achievement in modern physics. 
He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.
